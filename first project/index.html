                        <h2> Jawaharlal Nehru: The Architect of Modern India</h2>
                        <p>On 15 August 1947,<strong>Nehru</strong>  became the first prime minister of independent India. He held the post until his death in 1964. He implemented moderate socialist economic reforms and committed India to a policy of industrialisation. Nehru also served as foreign minister of India.</p>

                        <p><strong> what was the role of Jawaharlal Nehru in the growth of economy of India?</strong><br>
                          <strong> PANDIT JAWAHARLAL NEHRU INITIATED TO FORTIFY INDIAN ECONOMY ...</strong>
                            Pandit Nehru got the blueprint of the First Five – Year Plan (1951 – 1959) prepared. It was very important since it played an important role for the development of the country. This plan provided much needed push to the agriculture sector and also for the establishment of industries.</p>
                           <br>
                           <p><strong>what was the Nehruvian model of growth and development?</strong><br>
                            The Nehruvian model of mixed economy was designed to maximise production capacities, which were awfully inadequate on the eve of India's independence. Public and private sector industries were both to contribute to overcoming the situation of scarcity prevailing at the dawn of independence in the country.</p>
